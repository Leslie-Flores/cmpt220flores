// Cannot Switch from Tabs to Spaces in GitHub
// This goes for all recent labs unless stated otherwise.

Hello. I'm sorry, but I cannot seem to change the tabs you see for each my lab
exercises for some strange reason. I've only recently changes tabs to spaces
in Notepad++. It cannot be fixed on GitHub for some reason.

Thank you! - L. Flores
